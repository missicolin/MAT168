Mathematical models are at the heart of all data science applications such as information searching (Google), machine learning (e.g., face recognition algorithms), airline-crew scheduling, social network analysis, and more.
This course discusses the mathematics used in the analysis of data and the models used to make optimal decisions. Methods include advanced linear algebra, graph theory, optimization, probability, and geometry. These are some of the mathematical tools necessary for the data classification, machine learning, clustering and pattern recognition and for planning scheduling, and ranking.

### Learning Goals:

Mathematical optimization is a technology widely used in engineering, business, and finance. This course uses and extends mathematical methods from linear algebra, calculus, and geometry. The students learn mathematical algorithms and fundamental concepts such as duality and high-dimensional geometry. They learn how to develop mathematical models for optimization problems and learn to use software to solve these models. Mastery of this course supports the development of clear analytical thinking. Mastery of this course also enhances familiarity with advanced computer technology and the algorithmic processes necessary for quantitative analysis and modeling. At the same time the course supports the ability to design mathematical models in a wide range of applied fields.
